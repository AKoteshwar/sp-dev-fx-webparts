      author: Velin Georgiev
      summary: This sample shows how AppSettings.ts file can be added and used within SharePoint Framewrok webparts similar to the Web.config / App.config key value app settings in .NET Framework projects. That allows better DevOps and continuous integration (CI/CD) automation. The AppSettings.ts is transpiled/compiled with your SPFx solution which differs from the way the web.config. With .Net web.config file we would be able to update independently without the need of compiling DLLs. If that behavior is required, you can store your app settings in a SharePoint list and change them from there. However, that will have performance degradation over if the setting was part of the SPFx code where the logic can get a setting value in milliseconds.

      summary: The React Content Query Web Part is a modern version of the good old Content by Query Web Part that was introduced in SharePoint 2007. Built for SharePoint 2016 and Office 365, this modern version is built against the new SharePoint Framework (SPFx) and uses the latest Web Stack practices. While the original Web Part was based on a XSLT templating engine, this React Web Part is based on the well known Handlebars templating engine, which empowers users to create simple, yet powerfull HTML templates for rendering the queried content. This new version also lets the user query any site collections which resides on the same domain url, add unlimited filters, query DateTime fields to the nearest minute rather than being limited to a day, and much more.

      author: Velin Georgiev
      summary: This sample shows how we can use the ReactiveX (RxJs) library with the SharePoint Framework to communicate between web parts through broadcasting events utilizing the Publish‚Äìsubscribe pattern. It enables a web part or component to emit event (broadcast message) and that event is received by other web parts or components that have been subscribed to receive it. Please note this is custom implementation of the Publish‚Äìsubscribe pattern by using the ReactiveX (RxJs) library. The SPFx will nativelly support this in future without the need of custom implementation through new SPFx api called Event Aggregator, but it is still in Alpha.
